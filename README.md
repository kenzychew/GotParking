# GotParking

Forecasts Singapore carpark availability ("~12 lots free in 20 min") instead of just showing
today's live lot-count, which is all that currently exists publicly. Classical predictive ML
(LightGBM) trained on LTA DataMall data, built to showcase ML engineering to GovTech/OGP.

## Layout

- `db/` — Supabase schema and RLS policies (ap-southeast-1)
- `poller/` — Cloudflare Worker, polls LTA DataMall every 5 min, triggers batch predictions
- `training/` — weekly GitHub Actions job, trains and promotes LightGBM (SINPA-pretrained
  first candidate, two-phase gate, benchmarked against historical-average AND persistence)
- `api/` — Vercel Python (sin1): poller-triggered batch forecasts + the public cached read
  endpoint (the only public API surface)
- `frontend/` — mobile-first PWA

## Status

Design locked: approved through /office-hours, /plan-eng-review, /autoplan (CEO + Design +
Eng), and a 2026-07-04 max-effort eng re-review (11 findings, all resolved and folded in —
see the design doc's GSTACK REVIEW REPORT). T1 signal validation done (all 10 seed carparks
confirmed). T0 SINPA spike done: GO — the first LightGBM pretrains on the SINPA historical
dataset and fine-tunes on live 2026 data (`docs/t0-sinpa-spike.md`). T2 schema applied and
verified live. Provisioning Phases 1-2 complete (`docs/provisioning-checklist.md`); Phases
3-6 (healthchecks, Cloudflare, Vercel, secrets) in progress.

T3 (poller) done: `poller/`, 38/38 tests green. T4 (api), T5 (training), T6 (frontend) are
building in parallel worktrees — see the design doc's Implementation Tasks for status.
